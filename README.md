deufwm stands for "desktop environment utilities for window managers"

Most desktop environments, such as XFCE, GNOME, KDE, Cinnamon, etc, all have built-in abilities for connecting to Wi-Fi, changing how loudness of the sound, changing the brightness of the screen, and showing the battery.

However, many window managers, such as TWM (which is what I'm currently using), don't have these. So I created these shell scripts.

This is not intended for anyone. Just a "backup" for me.

If you want to use these, you might need to adjust the code to fit your needs

These utilities are required:
1. NetworkManager (for wifi)
2. amixer (for loudness)
3. xrandr (for brightness)
4. acpi (for battery)


Sorry if my English (or how I say things) is bad/awkward. I'm not fluent in English.
